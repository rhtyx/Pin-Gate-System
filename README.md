# Pin-Gate-System
This is a project made with Proteus 8.9. The project name is Pin Gate System. The project will secure your particular building using pin system.

How to simulate this project using Proteus 8.9.
1. Open this project using Proteus 8.9
2. Klik Run the simulation button located on the lower left cornet. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86037624/126878153-1c7eff56-fef9-42f1-b3df-76d21c3dacf5.png)

To use this gate system, you need to set the pin of the gate first. The pin has 4 digit. This is how to set the pin.
1. Before setting the pin, don't forget to run the simulation.
2. This is the first state of the switches to set the pin.

3. Push switch DIGIT 1 to set DIGIT 1 of the pin.

6. Do step 3 to step 6 to set 3 other digits of the pin.

7. When the pin is set, press the pin button to open the gate. When the pin is pressed, the first 3 led indicator will light up.

8. When the pin is correct, the gate will open and the last led indicator will light up.

*NOTE: THERE IS A LOT OF FRAGILITY IN THIS PROJECT. YOU CAN STILL PRESS THE PIN BUTTON TO SEARCH THE CORRECT PIN (UNTIL THE INDICATOR LIGHT UP).
